# MyCustomCalculator

# Introduction
This Python program implements a custom calculator class `MyCustomCalculator`. It provides methods to convert infix expressions to postfix and prefix notations, evaluate postfix expressions, and display the results.

# How to Run
To run the calculator program, follow these steps:

# Here is an example:
Enter arithmetic expression in infix notation (2 + 1 * 3): 4 + 1 * 5 
The Calculation's result: 25
Prefix Expression Result: ['*', '+', '4', '1', '5']
Postfix Expression Result: ['4', '1', '+', '5', '*']

# Grammar of the Language:

- Simple arithmetic expressions in infix notation.
- The supported operators are addition (+) and multiplication (*).
Operands are integers.

# Type of Parser:

The code utilizes a simple parser that operates on arithmetic expressions in infix notation.
The parser tokenizes the input expression and processes it based on predefined rules to generate postfix and prefix expressions.

# Method of Translation and Integration of Parser and Translation:
# Parsing:
The to_postfix method parses the infix expression and converts it into a postfix expression using a stack-based algorithm.
The parser handles operator precedence by evaluating it during the parsing process.
# Translation:
The evaluate method evaluates the postfix expression generated by the parser to compute the result of the arithmetic expression.
The to_prefix method reverses the input expression, converts it into postfix notation using the to_postfix method. 
And then,it reverses the resulting postfix expression to obtain the prefix expression.
This integration ensures that both the parsing and translation processes work seamlessly together to provide the desired results.
